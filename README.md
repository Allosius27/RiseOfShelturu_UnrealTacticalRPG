# RiseOfShelturu_UnrealTacticalRPG

In a kingdom where the practice of necromancy is punishable by death, your objective is to counter the army of the Vindicators. To do this, you'll use the remains of your enemies to fight on your side, with the ultimate goal of saving the members of your village.

It's a 3d tactical RPG that I'm developing on Unreal Engine 5 in C++. The project is still under development, with more information and content to come.
Here is only the game source code.
